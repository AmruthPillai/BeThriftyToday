## Short Description

Be Thrifty Today is a simple and secure money management app that helps you track your incomes and expenses. It is designed in a way that helps you become financially vigilant within seconds of using the app.

## Description

Be Thrifty Today is a simple side project that started out of bare necessities. I have had the habit of keeping an eye on my incomes and expenses for quite some time now, and I‚Äôve used many apps on the market that have aided me for quite some time, but I always found that it fell short in one or more areas. I like to have complete control over my finances and that‚Äôs why Be Thrifty Today was born. It is a simple money management application for those who want complete oversight over their incomes and expenses and setting budgets too.

Inside the app, you should be able to find a simple to use User Interface that allows you to add new incomes or expenses along with assigning the transaction with a cute and colourful icon to indicate its category. You can delete transactions made by simply swiping from right to left on the list item, and edit them by holding down the transaction. It has been designed in an intuitive way, quick to add, easy to navigate.

I do not plan to monetize this project at any time. It‚Äôs a free app without any ads and will continue to be so. I would also love to share what I have learned about building this application, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve made the application‚Äôs code open-source and open for contribution by anyone in the developer community. The source is built with Flutter & Firebase, so if you‚Äôre an enthusiast of any of the two, drop me an email/leave a rating below and I‚Äôll get back to you :)

Oh, and in line with saving the best for last... There‚Äôs also a dark mode! üï∂Ô∏è

## Features

- Manage your income and expenses with ease, both on Mobile, Web & Desktop (coming soon).
- Choose from a wide variety of categories with colourful icons that spice up the mundane task of money management.
- Encrypts all sensitive user information using AES-256 so that data is unreadable by anyone except authorized applications and you.
- Attention to detail, user interface design and enhanced usability is at the topmost priority (so if there‚Äôs a typo, don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know).
- No pesky push notifications, that bother you in the middle of the night.
- It doesn‚Äôt require read/write access to your phone storage or your SMSes, it‚Äôs completely air-gapped and secure.
- Ability to export income/expense transactions of a certain time period to CSV or JSON.
- Your data is completely secure, there is no social aspect to this application. Your finances are yours alone, and you have complete control over them.
- Set up biometric authentication in the Settings page so the app will allow access only to you and no one else using the phone. It uses your device‚Äôs biometrics, so you don‚Äôt need to set it up all over again. (available only on phones with fingerprint readers)
- You can request to add new categories or new features by dropping me an email at bethriftytoday@gmail.com and I‚Äôll add them as soon as I have the time to work on it.
- This app is ad-free, and always will be.

### Features that were released in v1.1.0

- You can now choose between 3 themes (Light, Dark and AMOLED)
- You can pick any accent colour from the choices, making it completely personalisable
- Users can sign in as a guest (still syncs your data to the cloud), but you won't have to divulge any personal information
- You can now create your own income/expense categories
- You can now enter your own currency symbols and use them within the app
- All values now have decimal places up to 2 places

## Security

As mentioned above, I've used a simple but uncrackable method to encrypt the sensitive information of a user's transactions so you can use the app in peace, knowing that no one else can ever read your data except you. In the spirit of complete transparency, here's a snapshot of the database

## Translation

Localization was possible using the Flutter Intl VS Code Plugin and Google's ARB (Application Resource Bundle) format which is powerful enough to handle some of the best usecases for language translations.

To translate the app into your own language, all you need to do are the following steps:
1) Fork the repository to your own account
2) Go to `lib/l10n` folder and clone the `intl_en.arb` into another file `intl_{code}.arb` where `code` is your ISO-639-1 (2 Alpha) Language Code.
3) Once you are done with the translation of strings, open a pull request to merge with the `develop` branch of the original repository.
4) Wait for me to approve the pull request so that I can generate the corresponding dart files and make changes in the settings screen. (Don't worry, I'm pretty quick when it comes to changes)

That's about it. Please do contribute as much as possible to the open source project, it would mean a lot to me as it would reach a whole lot of people out there. Thank you so much!

## License

The source code and product are governed under the Apache License 2.0 which can read here: [LICENSE](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/BeThriftyToday/blob/master/LICENSE). It allows for open source contribution and resharing of work :)

## Contributing

If you are a developer yourself, please create a Pull Request to fix/add what you feel like and I'll review it into the application :) Thank you so much!

Please be aware that running the project requires certain files such as the Google Services JSON and the Encryption Functions Dart File which I have consciously kept out of source control. To those who are willing to contribute to the project, you can generate your own Firebase project and get the corresponding `google-services.json` and `Google-Service-Info.plist`.

For the missing `encrypt.dart` file which is required to build the application, here is a gist with the file's contents, stripped off of the encryption key which is used in the production app: https://gist.github.com/AmruthPillai/3d99758a3836b909d331a90601023f53
